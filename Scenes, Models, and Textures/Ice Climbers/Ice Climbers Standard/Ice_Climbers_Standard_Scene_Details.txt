Note: The alternate blend switches the positions of each climber. Nana in the front, and Popo in the back. However the PopoTex_stocks file is used for the stock fur on both blends. If you want them to switch positions or to have Nana as the stock use the alternate blend.

This alternate blend is used on stocks for Ice Climbers 2, 5, and 6.
