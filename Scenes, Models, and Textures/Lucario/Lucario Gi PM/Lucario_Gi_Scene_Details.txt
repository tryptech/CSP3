Notes:
For the LucarioBody and LucarioFace textures use the original from Lucario Standard whenever possible.

Eye Shadow overlay at fac: 0.122727 at colour 2, with colour 1: BCBCBC in hex.
To ensure consistency with the default costume the original Lucario chest and head are used instead of the model originally from this outfit. This means that Polygons 1-26, and 29-37 from the Gi costume were deleted. Parts from Standard Lucario that were added are polygons 1-20, and polygons 24-26.
Polygon 26 from Standard Lucario was heavily modified to only show the chest, tail, dreads, and hand spikes, legs were manually removed. The Upper bod polygon from Gi Lucario was also slightly modified to better conform to the model.
