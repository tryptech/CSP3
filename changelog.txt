Cosmetic Standardization Project 2.5 Update Notes

-For maximum compatability with ColorSmash we have updated the portable launcher to GIMP 2.8.22, please do not use any future versions of GIMP for this project as it will cause slight differences when resizing.

-The new default stock system is for ColorSmash Ready stocks. The gimp plug-in has been updated to have three options, ColorSmash Ready, and the original CI4 and HD options. We recommend releasing packs with all three options.
