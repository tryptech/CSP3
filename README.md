Currently in progress.

Contains formerly planned changes from 2020 and 2021.

Notable changes include:
-
Removed GIMP in and simplified the process into Blender. Uses [Render Button & Camera Manager](https://blenderartists.org/t/render-button-camera-manager-for-blender-3-quick-fix-07-04-2022-v0-3-9/1159414) to render all necessary images at once.

Moving to Eevee by default.
